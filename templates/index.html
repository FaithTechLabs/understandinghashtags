          #MeToo is a social media hashtag that seeks to raise awareness about sexual harassment and assault by asking anyone who has experienced this kind of abuse to identify themselves by saying #MeToo.

            <li>Some feel it is backwards to list the victims, while the perpetrators remain anonymous</li>
            <li>Should the onus be on survivors to “out” themselves as victims?</li>

        <h2>Understanding <b>#MeToo</b></h2>

        <p>
          “Christians believe that the world is profoundly broken, but we also believe that God is actively redeeming it and that we are part of that process. Living in this tension means having a clear-eyed view of the world as it is while simultaneously envisioning what it could be. Insofar as #metoo helps us better understand the dangers women face as we try to navigate careers, dating relationships, or even riding the subway, it is powerful. But this knowledge must also move us toward redemption. If we commit to anything, let it be that none of us—man or woman—should have to carry the weight of brokenness alone.” <i>- Hanna Anderson, Christianity Today</i>
